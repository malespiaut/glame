@chapter Graphical Frontend (glame)

CAVEATS: Don't expect too much from the current GUI. It's just a first
approach to have something to play and test with. It will be rewritten
from scratch in the near future. The current implementation isn't too
clever and doesn't handle pipe parameters at all. Use the GUI if you
want to play around a little with GLAME. Use cglame, the command line
interface, for the real stuff.

The graphical frontend is invoked with the command @file{glame}. If you
are lucky, your GNOME libs are recent enough and a window will pop up,
displaying icons for all available plugins. Right clicking on an icon
shows some information on filter properties.

Now choose 
'New Filter Network' from the 'File' menu, and the next window will
show up. You can drag'n'drop icons from the plugin window to the 
network window. Connections between two nodes in the network are added
by left clicking on the blue are in the source icon and drawing a line to
the red region of the target icon. A right click on a node icon pops up
a window where you can alter parameter settings. Use the middle mouse 
button to remove nodes and connections from the network.

Click on the buttons on the bottom of the network window to start, pause, and
stop a network.

@subheading Example
To play back the stereo file @file{foo.wav} with a little echo, create a new
filter network from the menu, then drop one read-file, one audio-out, and 
two echo icons in the network window. Right click on the read-file icon and
set the filename to @file{foo.wav}. Draw a connection from read-file to
each of the echo nodes. Connect both echo nodes to audio-out, hit the Play 
button and that should be it.
