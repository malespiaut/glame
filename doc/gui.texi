@chapter Graphical Frontend (glame)

The graphical frontend is called @code{glame} and either reachable
from your path (where you installed glame to) or from @code{src/gui/glame}
which you should call if you didnt install glame but are executing it
out of the compiled source tree. Be sure to reside in the @code{src}
directory in this case, so GLAME can find its plugins.

The graphical frontend consists of three parts, the main window that is
active at the beginning and the wave editor and the filternetwork editor
that can be activated later. GLAME is very intuitive at the moment, so
just try pressing the right mouse button and context sensitive menus
will pop up with items with very descriptive names.
