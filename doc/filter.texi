For a brief overview of the available functions and macros you may
look at the central @file{filter.h} headerfile.
The filter subsystem should have settled now. So you may expect
existing API functions and semantics not to change in the near future.

The filter subsystem has three independent APIs, one for the filter registry,
one for filter programming and one for using the filters and connecting them
to so called filter networks.

@section Introducing the Filter Subsystem

The filter subsystem introduces the concepts of filters and networks of
filters. The basic idea is to have streams transporting arbitrary data
with attached properties floating through a network. This network comprises 
of so called @dfn{filter nodes} which are connected to each other through
@dfn{filter pipes}. The filter nodes may modify the data in the streams
and its properties. A filter node can even merge two or more streams into
one stream or split one stream into any number of streams containing the
same data and the same properties by reference.
To tune the operations on the stream each filter node may be assigned a
number of parameters. Each filter pipe can be assigned a number of parameters
at both ends, too.

From the API's point of view there are two classes of objects, the 
descriptors and
their instances. Descriptors in the filter subsystem are @code{filter_t},
@code{filter_portdesc_t} and @code{filter_paramdesc_t} with their corresponding
instances @code{filter_node_t}, @code{filter_pipe_t} and @code{filter_param_t}.
@code{filter_pipe_t} is a special case as a filter pipe is actually
an instance of two filter ports---it is a connection between these ports.

Not mentioned here is the @code{filter_network_t} instance. A filter network
is an instance of a @code{filter_t}, too. Think of it as an extension of a
filter node. This exchangability of filter nodes and filter networks and their
description as filters is one of the major features of the filter subsystem.
This means that you can set up a network of filters, and in turn convert this
filter network into an abstract filter which you can use in another filter
network by instantiating it.


@node Filter Initialisation, The Filter Registry API, Introducing the Filter Subsystem, Filter API
@section Filter Initialisation

The filter subsystem is initialized statically. To register available
filters you have to call @code{glame_init()} from the glame midlayer.


@node The Filter Registry API, The Filter Programming API, Filter Initialisation, Filter API
@section The Filter Registry API

The filter registry API is used by the filters to build and register
themselves and by any external program which wants to get access to the
filter. Note that the filter registry API is not necessarily thread
consistent.

The filter registry API is stronly coupled with the plugin API as the
plugin infrastructure is used to store and query existing filters. Only
allocation, building and associating a filter with a plugin is contained
in the filter registry API.

@node Defining Filter I/O, Getting Filter Info, , The Filter Registry API
@subsection Defining Filter I/O

To register itself, a new filter has to specify its supported input and
output ports and its optional parameters. The recommended order of
registration is the following: First, allocate a filter structure via
@code{filter_alloc()}. Second, in arbitrary order register all input
ports via @code{filter_add_input()}, all output ports via
@code{filter_add_output()} and all parameters via
@code{filterpdb_add_param()}.  Fourth, associate the filter with an
existing plugin record using @code{filter_attach()}.

@tindex filter_t
@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefun {filter_t *} filter_alloc (int (*@var{f})(filter_node_t *))
@code{filter_alloc()} will allocate a new filter structure.
The filter method will be set to the
provided function @code{@var{f}()} which is the only mandatory method for 
filters.
@code{filter_alloc()} returns a handle to the filter or @code{NULL} on error.
For the description of optional filter methods you can look at 
@ref{Filter Methods}.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_t
@deftypefun {filter_t *} filter_from_network (filter_network_t *@var{net})
@code{filter_from_network()} is another possibility to create a new filter.
Unlike @code{filter_alloc()} you get a full featured filter, including all
ports and parameters. Using this function you get the ability to turn a
complex filter network into an easily usable filter
(@pxref{Using Filter Networks as Filters}).
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_portdesc_t
@tindex filter_t
@deftypefun {filter_portdesc_t *} filter_add_input (filter_t *@var{f}, const char *@var{label}, const char *@var{description}, int @var{type})
@tindex filter_portdesc_t
@tindex filter_t
@deftypefunx {filter_portdesc_t *} filter_add_output (filter_t *@var{f}, const char *@var{label}, const char *@var{description}, int @var{type})
@code{filter_add_input()} and @code{filter_add_output()} add an input or
output port respectively to filter @var{f} with the specified @var{label} 
and @var{description}.
@var{type} specifies the supported connection types as a
mask with the additional flag @code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_AUTOMATIC} which
specifies that the port will accept multiple connections to it. 
The currently supported port types are
@code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_SAMPLE}, @code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_RMS},
@code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_MISC} and @code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_ANY} which does
allow any type of input or output. @code{filter_add_input()} and
@code{filter_add_output()} will return the port description structure on
success and @code{NULL} on error.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void filter_delete_port (filter_t *@var{f}, filter_portdesc_t *@var{port})
@code{filter_delete_port()} will remove and destroy the specified port from
filter @var{f}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {filter_pdb_t *} filter_pdb (filter_t *@var{f})
@deftypefunx {filter_pdb_t *} filterportdesc_pdb (filter_portdesc_t *@var{p})
@code{filter_pdb()} gets you access to the filters parameter database to
which you may add parameters using the @code{filterpdb_add_param*()}
functions. @code{filterportdesc_pdb()} returns the parameter database of
the specified port descriptor.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun void filter_attach (filter_t *@var{f}, plugin_t *@var{p})
Using @code{filter_attach()} you can assiociate the filter @var{f} with
the specified plugin and make it accessible to the world. You either
get the plugin record passed to your register function or may allocate
a new one using @code{plugin_add()} from the plugin API.
@end deftypefun



@node Getting Filter Info, , Defining Filter I/O, The Filter Registry API
@subsection Getting Filter Info

To query information about an existing filter like available parameters, output
or input ports the following functions can be used.
@emph{Remember that any structure returned by this functions is strictly 
read-only.}

To access the filter's input and output ports and in turn query information
about them you should use the following functions.

@deftypefun int filter_nrinputs (filter_t *@var{f})
@deftypefunx int filter_nroutputs (filter_t *@var{f})
These functions return the number of input and output ports assigned to the
filter @var{f}.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_portdesc_t
@tindex filter_t
@deftypefun {filter_portdesc_t *} filter_get_inputdesc (filter_t *@var{f}, const char *@var{label})
@tindex filter_portdesc_t
@tindex filter_t
@deftypefunx {filter_portdesc_t *} filter_get_outputdesc (filter_t *@var{f}, const char *@var{label})
Using these functions you can query the filter about its input and output ports
by name. Both functions return a port description structure which you can access
using the later described functions, or @code{NULL} if there is no port with
the specified name.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_portdesc_t
@tindex filter_t
@deftypefn Iterator {} filter_foreach_inputdesc (filter_t *@var{f}, filter_portdesc_t *@var{d}) @{ @}
@tindex filter_portdesc_t
@tindex filter_t
@deftypefnx Iterator {} filter_foreach_outputdesc (filter_t *@var{f}, filter_portdesc_t *@var{d}) @{ @}
With these two iterators you can loop through all available ports of the
filter @var{f} just like in the @code{for} construct using @var{d} as running
variable.
@end deftypefn

To access information in the port description structure
use the following functions.

@deftypefun {const char *} filterportdesc_label (filter_portdesc_t *@var{d})
@deftypefunx {const char *} filterportdesc_description (filter_portdesc_t *@var{d})
@deftypefunx int filterportdesc_type (filter_portdesc_t *@var{d})
@code{filterportdesc_label()} and @code{filterportdesc_description()} return 
label or description of the port respectively. With 
@code{filterportdesc_type()} you can query the type mask of the pipes that are
allowed to connect.
@end deftypefun


To query existing parameters or their number of the filter or its ports
you have to use the @code{filterpdb_*()} functions operating on the
specific parameter database which you can access using the
@code{filter_pdb()} and @code{filterportdesc_pdb()} functions described
above.



@node The Filter Programming API, The Filter Network API,The Filter Registry API, Filter API
@section The Filter Programming API

The filter programming API consists of functions to receive, create and forward
buffers, of functions to access the connections made to the filters ports, and
of functions to get and set the filters parameters. The filter programming API
also defines the semantics of the methods provided by the filters itself as
they are used by the filter network API. The filter programming API is
designed to be thread safe.

@end menu

@node Filter Methods, Accessing Filter Ports and Parameters, , The Filter Programming API
@subsection Filter Methods

Let's start with defining the semantics of the methods a filter can provide.
All methods are stored in the 
@tindex filter_t
@code{filter_t} structure, but only the @code{f()} method is
mandatory. You have to set all other methods explicitly---sane defaults are
provided for them. To learn about semantic details you may want to look into
the file @file{src/filter/filter_network.c}, too.

@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefn Method int f (filter_node_t *@var{n})
@code{f()} is the main method of every filter, it's the only mandatory method. 
@code{f()} does the filter work, i.e. it gets launched as thread once the
filter network starts operating. See below for what to do in this
method. You have to return -1 if you don't like anything of the setup,
which will terminate the whole network, or 0 if everything was ok and you
are finished with processing.

@findex FILTER_AFTER_INIT
@findex FILTER_DO_CLEANUP
@findex FILTER_BEFORE_CLEANUP
Required parts of the @code{f()} method are an initialization section which
must be ended by a call of the @code{FILTER_AFTER_INIT} macro and a cleanup
section which @code{FILTER_BEFORE_CLEANUP} has to precede. In the initialization
section you may not use any functions which may block on the network. You may
return -1 at any point during the initialization indicating an error. Once your
code hits @code{FILTER_AFTER_INIT}, returning 0 is mandatory though. In the
init section, use macro @code{FILTER_DO_CLEANUP} for a jump to the cleanup
section. 
For further advise see the @ref{Filter Tutorial}.
@end deftypefn

@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefn Method int init (filter_node_t *@var{n})
@code{init()} gets called by the @code{filternetwork_add_node()} function after allocating a
new instance of a filter (the so called filternode). You may do
anything with the private field of the filternode and attach signal
handlers to the nodes emitter, everything else is strictly
private. If you return -1 the node is deleted and @code{filternetwork_add_node()} will return an error. If everything is ok you should return 0.
@end deftypefn

@tindex filter_node_t
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefn Method int connect_out (filter_node_t *@var{source}, const char *@var{port}, filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@code{connect_out()} is invoked by the @code{filternetwork_add_connection()} 
function.
@code{connect_out()} gets called at each connection request to an output port
but before the call to the @code{connect_in()} method of the corresponding
destination port. You may reject the connection by returning -1 or
accept it by returning 0. You should set up the pipe type and the
corresponding fields in the type-specific union using the appropriate macros.
You may modifiy the pipe's source, i.e. perform redirections---but be careful.
After the connection has been created a @code{GLSIG_PIPE_CHANGED} signal is
raised on the new pipe.
@end deftypefn

@tindex filter_node_t
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefn Method int connect_in (filter_node_t *@var{dest}, const char *@var{port}, filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@code{connect_in()} is like @code{connect_out()} but gets called after the 
@code{connect_out()}
call, and you don't have to set up any type specific information in the
filter pipe @var{p}. Just return -1 if you don't like the connection. 
Otherwise return 0. Redirections of the destination may be done under the
same conditions as in @code{connect_out()}. After the connection has been
created a @code{GLSIG_PIPE_CHANGED} signal is raised on the new pipe.
@end deftypefn

@tindex filter_node_t
@tindex filter_param_t
@deftypefn Method int set_param (filter_node_t *@var{dest}, filter_param_t *@var{p}, const void *@var{val})
The @code{set_param()} method can be used to check a value which is to be
setted against some conditions. The method is invocated before the change
takes place and you may reject the change by returning -1. Returning 0
will do the parameter change and raise a @code{GLSIG_PARAM_CHANGED} signal
on the parameter.
@end deftypefn


Each filternode has a signal emitter associated to it through which all
of the signals from its sub-objects are re-emitted. So may want to add
signal handlers to the filters emitter.


@node Accessing Filter Ports and Parameters, Doing Real Work, Filter Methods, The Filter Programming API
@subsection Accessing Filter Ports and Parameters

As important as the semantics of the filters methods are the functions through
which a filter can access the pipes connected to its input and output 
ports and the parameters at the filter node scope as well as at the pipe scope.
The description of these functions follow.

@deftypefun {const char *} filternode_name (filter_node_t *@var{n})
Using this function you get access to the name of the filternode @var{n}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int filternode_nrinputs (filter_node_t *@var{n})
@deftypefunx int filternode_nroutputs (filter_node_t *@var{n})
These functions return the number of connections on the input and output ports.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_pipe_t
@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefun {filter_pipe_t *} filternode_get_input (filter_node_t *@var{n}, const char *@var{label})
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefunx {filter_pipe_t *} filternode_get_output (filter_node_t *@var{n}, const char *@var{label})
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefunx {filter_pipe_t *} filternode_next_input (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefunx {filter_pipe_t *} filternode_next_output (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
The @code{filternode_get_*()} functions provide you with access to the filter
node's connections on the specified input or output port by name. If there
is more than one connection on a port you may cycle through all connections
using the @code{filternode_next_*()} functions which
will return the next connection on the same port where
the first connection on the port was accessed using @code{filternode_get_*()}. 
This is useful for ports with the @code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_AUTOMATIC} flag 
set only.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_node_t
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefn Iterator {} filternode_foreach_input (filter_node_t *@var{n}, filter_pipe_t *@var{p}) @{ @}
@tindex filter_node_t
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefnx Iterator {} filternode_foreach_output (filter_node_t *@var{n}, filter_pipe_t *@var{p}) @{ @}
These programming structures loop through all connections on input or
output ports of the specified filter node.
This is especially useful for filters with only one input or output port
which additionally is of the type @code{FILTER_PORTTYPE_AUTOMATIC}. It acts
like the @code{for} construct, i.e. the parameter @var{p} is assigned 
the input or output pipe on each loop iteration.
@end deftypefn


@tindex filter_pipe_t
To access information contained in the @code{filter_pipe_t} structures returned
by the above functions, you may use the following functions. Also functions
to access the per-pipe-end parameters and the corresponding parameter
databases are described here.

@deftypefun int filterpipe_type (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@code{filterpipe_type()} will return the type of the pipe.
@end deftypefun


@findex connect_out
To initialize a pipe inside the @code{connect_out()} method or any
signal handler you should use one of the following boilerplate
functions. Also the per-pipe-type access methods you should use are
described here, grouped by pipe type. Note that if you actually change a
pipes type or its parameters you have to raise a
@code{GLSIG_PIPE_CHANGED} signal on the pipe, @strong{except} you are in
one of the @code{connect_*()} methods.

@deftypefun void filterpipe_settype_sample (filter_pipe_t *@var{p}, int @var{rate}, float @var{hangle})
@tindex FILTER_PIPETYPE_SAMPLE
@deftypefunx int filterpipe_sample_rate (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@deftypefunx float filterpipe_sample_hangle (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@code{filterpipe_settype_sample()} sets the pipe type to
@code{FILTER_PIPETYPE_SAMPLE} and initializes the type specific
@code{rate} and @code{hangle} field to the value provided.
@code{filterpipe_sample_rate()} and @code{filterpipe_sample_hangle()}
return the pipes sample rate and its horizontal angle respectively.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {filter_pdb_t *} filterpipe_sourcepdb (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@deftypefunx {filter_pdb_t *} filterpipe_destpdb (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
These functions get you access to the pipes parameter database connected
to the source or the destination end of the pipe. You may operate on
the database using the @code{filterpdb_*()} functions.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {filter_param_t *} filterpipe_get_sourceparam (filter_pipe_t *@var{p}, const char *@var{label})
@deftypefunx {filter_param_t *} filterpipe_get_destparam (filter_pipe_t *@var{p}, const char *@var{label})
With these wrappers around @code{filterpipe_*pdb()} and
@code{filterpdb_get_param()} you get access to the pipes per-end
parameters by name. The wrappers will return @code{NULL} if the
requested parameter does not exist.
@end deftypefun


To get access to the parameters of a filter node, to the nodes parameter
datatbase and to access the information contained inside the
@code{filter_param_t} structure, the following functions are provided.

@deftypefun {filter_pdb_t *} filternode_pdb (filter_node_t *@var{n})
This function provides you access to the filternodes parameter database
which you can operate on using the @code{filterpdb_*()} functions.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_param_t
@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefun {filter_param_t *} filternode_get_param (filter_node_t *@var{n}, const char *@var{label})
This wrapper around @code{filterpipe_*pdb()} and
@code{filterpdb_get_param()} gets you access to the filternodes
parameters by name. The wrapper will return @code{NULL} if the requested
parameter does not exist.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int filterparam_val_int (filter_param_t *@var{p})
@deftypefunx float filterparam_val_float (filter_param_t *@var{p})
@deftypefunx SAMPLE filterparam_val_sample (filter_param_t *@var{p})
@deftypefunx {char *} filterparam_val_string (filter_param_t *@var{p})
These macros return the value of the parameter. You should use the macro
which corresponds to the parameter type (which you should know anyway or
you can obtain from the corresponding parameter descriptor structure).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {char *} filterparam_to_string (const filter_param_t *@var{p})
This function provides a convenience way to convert the value of a filter
parameter into a string representation which can be used again to set the
value of another parameter. @code{NULL} can be returned on memory shortage,
the caller should take care of freeing the returned string.
@end deftypefun


@node Doing Real Work, Working on SAMPLEs, Accessing Filter Ports and Parameters, The Filter Programming API
@subsection Doing Real Work

Now what to do inside the @code{f()} method? Receiving, modifying, creating, and
forwarding streams of data which are grouped into buffers is the answer. 
This leads us to the filter buffer API. A filter buffer is obtained using 
one of the following functions:

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefun {filter_buffer_t *} fbuf_alloc (int @var{size}, struct list_head *@var{list})
@code{fbuf_alloc()} will allocate a new buffer with space for @var{size}
bytes. The list parameter is to 
keep track of allocated buffers for cleanup after failures. You may want to
supply @code{&n->launch_context->buffers} for @var{list}.
This function can return @code{NULL} if the system is short on memory.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefun {filter_buffer_t *} fbuf_get (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@code{fbuf_get()} receives the next filter buffer from the specified input
pipe. It will return @code{NULL} at @code{EOF}. You have to forward the 
@code{EOF} mark. @code{fbuf_get()} copes with a @code{NULL} @var{p} by just
returning @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

All filter buffers are reference counted to allow zero-copy and copy-on-demand
operations. Both @code{fbuf_alloc()} and @code{fbuf_get()} will return with 
one reference of the
buffer held. To get additional references or to drop one reference use the
following functions:

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@deftypefun void fbuf_ref (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{fbuf_ref()} will get you one additional reference. A reference will
protect the buffer from being modified and from being destroyed. Once
the reference count drops to zero, you may no longer access it or any
of its contents. @code{fbuf_ref()} does not copy the buffer. @code{fbuf_ref()}
ignores @code{NULL} @var{fb}s.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@deftypefun void fbuf_unref (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{fbuf_unref()} will drop one reference. See above for more about
references. @code{fbuf_unref} ignores @code{NULL} @var{fb}s.
@end deftypefun

To get information on a filter buffer and to access its contents, use the
following functions which are actually very fast macros:

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@deftypefun int fbuf_size (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{fbuf_size()} returns the number of bytes in the filter buffer.
@code{fbuf_size()} returns 0 if @var{fb} is @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@deftypefun {char *} fbuf_buf (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{fbuf_buf()} returns a pointer to the buffer's contents.
@end deftypefun

If you want to modify a buffer directly rather than reading from a received one
and storing into a freshly allocated one, you have to make the buffer private.
This additional requirement makes copy-on-demand and zero-copy possible. Use
@code{fbuf_make_private()}:

@tindex filter_buffer_t
@deftypefun {filter_buffer_t *} fbuf_make_private (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{fbuf_make_private()} will return a private copy of the provided buffer
which you may modify. @code{fbuf_lock()} will not copy the buffer if you are the
sole user of the buffer, i.e. the reference count is one. For a @code{NULL}
@var{fb} @code{fbuf_mark_private()} returns @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

To forward a filter buffer you have to hold one reference for each output pipe
you send the buffer to. Buffer sending is done using the following function:

@tindex filter_pipe_t
@tindex filter_buffer_t
@deftypefun void fbuf_queue (filter_pipe_t *@var{p}, filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{fbuf_queue()} queues the specified filter buffer to the specified pipe.
One reference gets eaten by this operation. @code{fbuf_queue()} copes with
a @code{NULL} @var{p} by unref'ing @var{fb}.
@end deftypefun

For extended protocols on top of the @code{fbuf} API have a look into 
@ref{Working on SAMPLEs}.


@node Working on SAMPLEs, , Doing Real Work, The Filter Programming API
@subsection Working on SAMPLEs

There is one extended protocol defined at the moment. This is the sbuf
protocol which is just a very simple @code{SAMPLE}-only 
transportation protocol with no fields in the header actually used. 
So only the functions with parameters or semantics different from their
@code{fbuf_*} equivalents are listed here. As for the rest, you may assume that
wrappers exist with the appropriate @code{sbuf_*} name but the same parameters
and semantics as described in the @code{fbuf_*} sections.

@deftypefun {filter_buffer_t *} sbuf_alloc (int @var{size}, filter_node_t *@var{n})
@code{sbuf_alloc()} allocates a new buffer containing space for @var{size}
numbers
of @code{SAMPLE}s and assigns the buffer to the filter node @var{n}.
@end deftypefun
@deftypefun int sbuf_size (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{sbuf_size()} returns the size of the buffer as number of @code{SAMPLE}s.
@end deftypefun
@deftypefun {SAMPLE *} sbuf_buf (filter_buffer_t *@var{fb})
@code{sbuf_buf()} returns a pointer to the buffer containing the @code{SAMPLE}s.
@end deftypefun

The filter network API provides functions to construct and run arbitrary
networks of filters. This part of the filter API is intended to be used by the
high level part of the glame project, i.e. the console and the graphical user

@deftypefn Iterator {} filternetwork_foreach_node (filter_network_t *@var{net}, filter_node_t *@var{node}) @{ @}
This iterator loops through all nodes in the network.

@tindex filter_node_t
@tindex filter_network_t
@deftypefun {filter_node_t *} filternetwork_add_node (filter_network_t *@var{net}, const char *@var{f}, const char *@var{name})
@code{filternetwork_add_node()} creates an instance of a filter with the
provided identifier @var{f} and adds it to the set of filters of the
specified filter network. The node is given the provided @var{name}, or a
unique one is chosen automatically if you pass @code{NULL}.
@code{filternetwork_add_node()} returns a handle to the instance of a filter,
a filter node, or @code{NULL}, if an error occured.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefun void filternode_delete (filter_node_t *@var{node})
@code{filternode_delete()} deletes the filter node and breaks all established
connections and deletes all set parameters.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_pipe_t
@tindex filter_node_t
@deftypefun {filter_pipe_t *} filternetwork_add_connection (filter_node_t *@var{source}, const char *@var{source_port}, filter_node_t *@var{dest}, const char *@var{dest_port})
@code{filternetwork_add_connection()} connects two filter nodes by using 
the output port specified as @var{source_port} and the input port 
specified as @var{dest_port}.
@code{filternode_add_connection()} returns the internal representation 
of the connection, a filter pipe on success or @code{NULL} if any party
disliked the connection.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_pipe_t
@deftypefun void filternetwork_break_connection (filter_pipe_t *@var{p})
@code{filternetwork_break_connection()} breaks a previously established
connection. Note that upon breakage some
filter nodes may decide to break additional connections to return
to a sane state of the network.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int filterparam_set (filter_param_t *@var{p}, const void *@var{val})
@deftypefunx int filterparam_set_string (filter_param_t *@var{p}, const char *@var{val})
Using one of these functions you can change a parameters value to the
one provided. As for the @code{filterparam_set()} method the value
parameter is untyped, you have to pass a reference to the actual to be
set value.  The parameter change may be rejected by the node and you
will get -1 as result in this case. On a successful change of the
parameter 0 is returned and a @code{GLSIG_PARAM_CHANGED} signal is
raised -- so be careful not to cause endless signal chains using these
functions.

@node Processing Data in a Network, Using Filter Networks as Filters, Creating a Filter Network, The Filter Network API
@subsection Processing Data in a Network

To start processing data with a constructed network the following functions are
provided:

@tindex filter_network_t
@deftypefun int filternetwork_launch (filter_network_t *@var{net})
@code{filternetwork_launch()} asynchronously starts the init phase of a 
previously constructed filter network using a set of filter threads.
@code{filternetwork_launch()} returns -1 if there were any problems launching
the filter network or 0 on success.
Errors in the initialisation process of the filters' @code{f()} methods are not
reported by @code{filternetwork_launch()} but can instead be obtained by using
@code{filternetwork_wait()} or @code{filternetwork_start()}. Processing of
the data is not started until @code{filternetwork_start()} is called.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_network_t
@deftypefun int filternetwork_start (filter_network_t *@var{net})
@deftypefunx int filternetwork_pause (filter_network_t *@var{net})
With @code{filternetwork_start()} you can start processing data on a
previously launched or paused network. With @code{filternetwork_pause()}
you can temporarily stop processing of any data in a previously started
network. Both functions return -1 if any error occured in the process of
starting, pausing or in the network threads.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_network_t
@deftypefun int filternetwork_wait (filter_network_t *@var{net})
@code{filternetwork_wait()} waits for a previously launched filter network to
finish processing.
@code{filternetwork_wait()} returns 0 if the filter network terminated
regularly, and -1 if there were any errors, either in waiting for the
network or in processing the network.
@end deftypefun

@tindex filter_network_t
@deftypefun void filternetwork_terminate (filter_network_t *@var{net})
@code{filternetwork_terminate} kills a previously launched filter network. It
doesn't wait for it to finish processing all data.
@end deftypefun


@node Using Filter Networks as Filters, Textual Representation of Filter Networks, Processing Data in a Network, The Filter Network API
@subsection Using Filter Networks as Filters

To save a filter network and reuse it as regular filter the following
functions are provided:

@tindex filter_network_t
@deftypefun {char *} filternetwork_to_string (filter_network_t *@var{net})
@code{filternetwork_to_string()} saves the current state of the filter
network into a string and returns a pointer to it. NULL is returned on
error. You have to @code{free()} the returned string later.
@end deftypefun
