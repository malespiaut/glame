@comment TODO: Which index should I list the plugins in?

Available GLAME plugins are listed here with a short description about what
they are able to do, their input and output ports, and the parameters 
they understand. Some ports allow more than one so-called pipe to be
connected. Those restrictions will be listed in the port description. 
Some parameters can be set per plugin, some per pipe. Pipe parameters are
listed with the name of the pipe preceeding the parameter name, separated
by a double colon, like @code{out::position} for parameter @code{position}
on pipe @code{out}. Each parameter is followed by its type--e.g. integer,
float, or string--in parentheses.

@section In- and Output

GLAME has several ways of importing and exporting audio data: via the
sound card, an external file, or an external program. Furthermore, GLAME
has its own so-called swapfile that is used as a large internal cache for
audio data.

@node Audio I/O, File I/O,, In- and Output
@subsection Audio I/O

The @file{audio-in} and @file{audio-out} plugins handle communication between 
GLAME and the sound hardware. @file{audio-in} is for recording, 
@file{audio-out} does the playback. 
Actually, there are several instances of those plugins for different sound
systems like ESD, ALSA, OSS, and native SGI. If available on the system, 
they can be accessed directly via @file{oss-audio-out}, @file{esd-audio-in} 
and the like, using the same sets of parameters. Think of @file{audio-in} and 
@file{audio-out} as sane default methods dependent on the system's capabilities.

@subsubheading Common parameters
@table @code
@item device (string)
Sound device to be used. Note: While audio-in and audio-out are generic plugins,
interpretation of the device parameter is dependent on the underlying sound
system which the value is passed to unmodified. For example, OSS takes devices
parameters like @file{/dev/dsp} where ALSA would like @code{0:0}. If
@code{device} is not set, the sound system's default device is used.

Transactions from and to files are handled by the plugins @file{read-file}
and @file{write-file}. @file{read-file} is guaranteed to be able to read
WAV files. Anything else is up to helper libraries that may or may not be
installed on a system. @file{write-file} so far only second guesses the
desired output format from the suffix of the given filename.

@subsection Generating Waves

GLAME comes with a number of plugins to generate waveforms within a 
filter network. They can be useful as a debugging aid, but also as 
control input to other plugins. Imagine a sine wave generator hooked up
to the position port of a panning filter... So far there are is a 
@code{sine} plugin for generating sine waves, and a @code{const}
plugin yielding a block of constant data. Both plugins emit but a short
chunk of data. For a continuous stream they have to be connected to a
repeat node.

@end table

@node Junctions and Dead Ends, Mangling Data Streams, Generating Waves, Elementary Plugins
@subsection Junctions and Dead Ends

In a filter network, data streams don't get created from nowhere, neither
do they disappear into a big black void: there must be a plugin at each
endpoint of a connection. These Plugins in turn are allowed to dump data or
create new streams.

The @file{drop} plugin is used as a sink for data that is no longer needed 
within the network. Any incoming data is simply discarded. It's the dead
end of a network.

If the same stream of data is needed more than once, it cannot simply be 
applied several times to different ports, it has to be duplicated first. 
@file{one2n} is the plugin to perform this task, it forks the network, so
to speak.

@file{mix} on the other hand acts as a junction and merges several data
streams into one, just like an ordinary mixing desk. The @file{mix} plugin
comes in two flavours, @file{mix}, and @file{mix2}. The only time to worry
about the differences is when you want to create loops in your network: 
@file{mix} drops all input data after the first input stream has terminated,
@file{mix2} continues to mix available inputs instead. Otherwise @file{mix}
and @file{mix2} are identical. Use @file{mix} for mixing feedback.

@subsubheading @file{drop} ports
@table @code
@item in (input)
Data to be dropped. Any number of input connections is allowed.
@end table

@file{drop} has no parameters.

@subsubheading @file{one2n} ports

@item position (float)
Horizontal placement of sample stream in radians from -pi to pi.
@end table

@node Mangling Data Streams, Orientation, Junctions and Dead Ends, Elementary Plugins
@subsection Mangling Data Streams

All the plugins described in this section operate on a single input stream 
and transform it into a slightly mangled single output stream. 
@file{volume-adjust} scales the amplitude of a data stream. 
@file{delay} and @file{extend} prepend and append zero samples to a data
stream respectively. @file{repeat} resends an input sequence over and over
for a fixed time. @file{invert} inverts all data of the input stream, i.e. 
each sample A is replaced by -A.

@subsubheading Common ports
@table @code
@item in (input)
Stream of input sample data.
@item out (output)
Stream of transformed output sample data.
@end table

@subsection Orientation

The @file{pan} plugin distributes a mono sample stream to two stereo
(left/right) output streams. 

@subsubheading @file{pan} ports
@table @code
@item in (input)
Mono stream to pan. Only a single connection allowed.
@item left-out (output)

Left/right stereo output stream. Only one connection per port is allowed.
@end table

@subsubheading @file{pan} parameters
@table @code
@item pan (float)
Pan value (virtual direction) of mono input stream. By default, @file{pan}
uses the input pipe's position property as pan value. It is overridden if
the @code{pan} parameter is set. Allowed values range from -pi/2 to pi/2. 
As the position property ranges from -pi to pi, values with magnitude 
larger than pi/2 (i.e. positions in the 'back') are mirrored to the front.
@end table

@node Arithmetics, The Sample Analyst, Orientation, Elementary Plugins
@subsection Arithmetics

The plugins @file{mul} and @file{add} perform a simple arithmetic operations
on several input streams. Basically, @file{mul} multiplies and @file{add}
sums up any number of input sample streams. Operations are performed
sample by sample--no check is performed whether sample rates match! 
If a stream is shorter than others, it is zero-padded internally.

Each plugin allows one multiplicative and one additive constant to be
set. They are interpreted differently for each plugin however, 
reflecting the different algorithms:

@file{mul} calculates each output sample by taking one sample from each
input pipe, adding @code{add} to it, multiplying the results, and
finally multiplying the result by @code{factor}.

@file{add} calculates each output sample by taking one sample from each
input pipe, summing them all up, adding the @code{add} parameter, and
multiplying the result by @code{factor}.

@subsubheading Common ports
@table @code
@item in (input)
Input sample stream. Any number of input connections is allowed.
@item out (out)
Output sample stream of computed data. Only one connection is allowed.
@end table

@subsubheading Common parameters
@table @code
@item add (float)
Additive constant, see above. Defaults to zero.
@item factor (float)
Multiplicative constant, see above. Defaults to one.
@end table

There are neither further specific ports, nor further specific parameters.

@node The Sample Analyst, Catching Bugs, Arithmetics, Elementary Plugins
@subsection The Sample Analyst

Analyzing sample data for things like peak values or a DC offset is
crucial for tuning parameters right on other plugins. The @file{statistic}
plugin is kind enough to take the burden of calculating those values. Its
output is obviously not a stream of sample data, but of statistical
values called an RMS stream. Unfortunately, RMS work within GLAME is still
in its early stages, so currently there is only one simple test plugin,
@file{debugrms}, that can actually understand an RMS input stream and
prints some of the gathered statistics to the console. 

@subsubheading @file{statistic} ports
@table @code
@item in (input)
Input sample stream to be analyzed. Only one connection is allowed.
@item out (output)
RMS data stream of gathered statistical data. Only one connection is
allowed.
@end table

@subsubheading @file{statistic} parameters
@table @code
@item windowsize (time)
Time in milliseconds of window for a single chunk of RMS data.

@table @code
@item in (input)
Input stream of RMS data to display.
@end table

@file{debugrms} has no parameters.

@node Catching Bugs, How to Code, The Sample Analyst, Elementary Plugins
@subsection Catching Bugs

Ping is a tool familiar to admins to test integrity and latency of a
network connection. The @file{ping} plugin does the same within a GLAME
filter network. It sends out a data packet from its output port and 
measures the time until the packet arrives at its input port. Obviously,
the filter network should have a loop structure or ping will wait 
endlessly for an input. Debugging output goes to the console.

@subsubheading @file{ping} ports
@table @code
@item in (input)
Input port packets are received at.
@item out (output)
Output port packets are sent from.
@end table

@subsubheading @file{ping} parameters
@table @code
@item cnt (integer)
Number of packets to send. Defaults to 10.
@item dt (integer)
Time in microseconds between successive packets. Defaults to 250000 
microseconds (1/4 second).
@item size (int)
Number of samples in a test packet. Defaults to 128 samples.
@end table

@node How to Code,, Catching Bugs, Elementary Plugins
@subsection How to Code

The @file{null} and @file{dup} plugins aren't really meant to be used,
they are simple reference implementations for developers looking for a
quick introduction to plugin programming. @file{null} passes an input
stream unmodified to its output, @file{dup} duplicates an input stream
to two output streams. In real life, the more complex @file{one2n}
plugin can be used to achieve the same results. So use the source, not 
these plugins.

@end table

@node Noisegate, IIR, Echo, Effects
@subsection Noisegate

A noisegate is used to filter out noise below a certain threshold from an
input stream. Its operation can be tuned by a number of parameters. 
When the input signal (its absolute value actually) falls below 
@code{threshold_on} for more than @file{hold} time, @file{noisegate}
suppresses output until the signal goes back up and above threshold_off.
Switching from and to zero output is usually not done instantaneously as this
would lead to distorted sound. Instead, a fading time can be given by
@code{attack} and @code{release} respectively.
