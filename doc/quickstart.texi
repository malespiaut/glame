@chapter Quick Start Guide

Moi Mr. Newcomer, hi Mrs. Impatient! 

Welcome to GLAME, the GNU/Linux Audio Mechanics. This is the Quick Start Guide
for all those who loathe reading lengthy documentation. So I won't fuzz with
details but try to get you going on basic tasks as fast as possible.

GLAME comes in two flavours, the graphical interface @file{glame} and the
console frontend called @file{cglame}. You'll have to be able to grok Scheme in
order to deal with @file{cglame}. It's extremely cool and powerful but it's
probably not what you are looking for when reading a quick start guide. So let's
talk about the graphical interface in the following, and send those Schemers off
to poke through the proper documentation.

@section A Quick Start to Editing Files

So you recorded this charming little chanson called Angelina, but she ditched
you the other day and now dates Ron instead? No need to keep waiting until
another Angelina passes your way. GLAME will help you changing your Angelina
tune into a hymn on Heather in an instant. (Admit it, you've been after Heather
for ages!)

Fire up @file{glame}, ignore the crappy splash screen, and what you'll see is
the so-called @dfn{Swapfile GUI}. Don't waste your time pondering about the
name, it's simply a view of all audio tracks that GLAME knows about. Tracks are
kept in a hierarchy of projects and further groups of tracks. To make your sweet
@file{angelina.wav} known to GLAME, first select @dfn{New Project} from the
@dfn{Project} menu. A new entry appears; name it No More Angelina. Then click
the right mouse button on the new entry, and a pop-up menu does what its name
suggests: it pops up right in front of you. Choose the entry called
@dfn{Import}, and select your @file{angelina.wav}. It's a stereo file, of
course. Therefore the Swapfile GUI now shows two entries within your Angelina
project, one for each track. Now you're all set to wipe poor Angelina if not
from your life, then at least from your art.

Once again, click on the No More Angelina entry in the Swapfile GUI, press the
right mouse button, and select @dfn{Edit} from the pop-up menu. What appears now
is the so-called @dfn{Waveedit GUI}, a window containing a graphical view of the
audio tracks in your project. (Of course you are tempted now to wipe Angelina
from one track only. Well, you could do that by selecting @dfn{Edit} on a single
track rather than the whole project. You could even edit one track in multiple
windows at the same time. But this is not the road we want to go down now. This
Angelina-bitch ditched you, remember? Let's wipe her from your song completely.)

The Waveedit GUI is mostly driven from a pop-up menu attached to the right mouse
button. Have a guess what @dfn{Play All} might do? Well, try it out. If you
can't hear a single note, check your mixer settings with an external mixer
program, and if all seems to be right, go back to the @dfn{Settings} menu in the
Swapfile GUI and check your Audio I/O preferences. Working now? Good. Want to
know how zoom in and out work? Ah, no, you figured that out yourself. Now you
have to identify the places in the song where your voice trembles Angelina. To
make it easier for you, during playback a vertical line will mark the region
currently playing. Of course you don't have to keep playing the song as a whole
over and over. There is @dfn{Play Selection} after all. What's a selection?
That's a highlighted region in the editing window. Press the left mouse button,
drag the mouse, release the mouse button again, and you'll get the trick. A lot
of things can be done with selections from the pop-up menu. They can for example
be played, zoomed into, cut, copied, and deleted. The latter is just what we
need now. Select each of the passages enchanting Angelina, delete them, and
there she goes.

So what about Heather? We'll be with her in an instant, but we have to learn a
bit about recording first.

@node Getmeinthere, Gottagetbetter, Getawaywithher, Quick Start Guide
@section A Quick Start to Audio Recording

Back we are at the Swapfile GUI. Let's add a new project, and name it Oh
Heather. That's where you're going to record into. Well, not quite. You can't
record into a project, of course, you can only record into tracks. So you need
to pull a track out of thin air, two of them actually, as you're going to
record stereo. The right mouse button again acts as your magic wand. It will
present you a menu item @dfn{Add stereo wave}, and that's exactly what you need
now. Add the two empty tracks, select your Heather project, and open the
Waveedit GUI on it, using the @dfn{Edit} entry in the pop-up menu.

The editing window doesn't look too interesting at the moment but that's what
you'd expect from an empty file. It'll change soon, so go launch your favourite
mixer application, and prepare your system as well as yourself for recording.
Once both of you feel in shape, come back to the editing window. @dfn{Record at
marker} is the preferred item in the pop-up menu now. A panel will appear
containing the four buttons @dfn{Record}, @dfn{Pause}, @dfn{Stop}, and
@dfn{Cancel}. Hitting the first one will start the recording. Finding out about
the meaning of the others is left as an exercise to the reader. Don't think too
hard about it, though, as now is the time to give a c-sharp Heather in your best
tremolo ever. You should've figured out to hit the @dfn{Stop} button by the time
you're done.

The rest is easy. In the Heather editing window, mark a selection only
containing you singing the name but none of the noise before and after. Pop-up
the menu with the right mouse button and hit @dfn{Copy}. Then move over to the
Angelina editing window, which should still be open. A click with the left mouse
button will mark a position in the song, and selecting @dfn{Paste} from the
pop-up menu will insert your Heather at this position. Where to insert the
section is entirely up to your artistic talent.

Not fancy enough to woo Heather, you feel? Read on.

@node Gottagetbetter, Gobackformore, Getmeinthere, Quick Start Guide
@section A Quick Start to Filter Networks

To brush up a selection from the Waveedit GUI, you can apply a single filter on
it. @dfn{Apply Filter} from the pop-up menu gets you going. But you can do even
better. Select @dfn{Apply Custom} and watch the @dfn{Filternetwork Editor} come
up. Here, you can not only apply a single filter, but a whole collection of
filters that interact with each other.

Think of the filter network as a factory of waves. It starts out on one or more
sources of sound waves, mangles the sound, and finally sends it off to one or
several consumers. There is already a source in the network, called
@file{swapfile_in}, and a consumer called @file{swapfile_out}.  Don't mess with
them, as they were already set up by the Waveedit GUI to work on the selection
you marked. It is your task now to build the individual steps in the factory
itself. That is, what should be done to your sound, and in which order. To this
end, you can insert filters into the network. They are your machines. Just hit
the right mouse button, and select one of the entries. A small icon will appear
depicting your new filter. Each filter has its inputs to the left, and its
outputs to the right. To connect two filters, you draw a line from the output
of the first to the input of the second, dragging the mouse with the left
button pressed down. Some filters do not possess both inputs and outputs.
You'll note this when one side of their icons is greyed out. Inputs and output
in general are not limited to a single connection. A filter will accept as many
connections as it can take, and reject any further.

For most filters, you want to tune their parameters, or their output will
probably not come close to what you intended. Press the right mouse button on
top of the filter image, and select the @dfn{Properties} entry. A new window
will show up, where you can tune the parameters to your liking. Once all
parameters are set, and all filters are connected, hit execute on the icon bar
on top. When processing is finished, go to the Waveedit GUI, and watch your
modified Heather tracks.

What's left to do? Back to the Swapfile GUI. It's about time to finally rename
the No More Angelina project to Hymn to Heather. How? Go figure. You really
should have gotten a good feeling of how GLAME works by now. Next, get the
pop-up menu up on Hymn to Heather. Select @dfn{Export...}, and save your song
as, say, @file{heather.wav}. As you may have guessed, the suffix determines the
type of file Hymn to Heather is stored as. Want details on that one? Hey, enough
is enough! Go read the proper docs if you're that interested. Or try on of the
@dfn{Help} entries that will present you a context sensitive entry from the
manual. 

Well done, you may call yourself a GLAMEr now. A Lamer even, if you don't get up
immediately and present your new song to Heather. Off you go. Good luck!

@section A Quick Start to Realtime Effects

Back with us again?  Oh rats, Heather finally broke your heart and left you?
Cheer up, there's Bozo "The Dragster"'s ultimate party next weekend, and
Bozo thinks you'll fit perfect with some of his best friends.  Wonder how
to break the ice?  Don't worry.  A microphone and
a box running GLAME, that's all you'll need to hook them up.

Let's get the setup straight first.  In the preferences dialog... Pardon me?
How to get to the preferences?  Gee, guess you need a couple of Angelinas and
Heathers still, until you're ready for Bozo.  Found it now?  Fine.  In the
preferences dialog, there's a little fine-tuning to do on @dfn{Audio I/O}
for a spiffy full-duplex setup, meaning that we're going to play and record
at the same time.  Select OSS and configure @file{/dev/dsp} for input, and
@file{/dev/dsp1} for output.  This'll work if your sound card is fancy enough
to offer more than one DSP device.  Otherwise, lend your neighbour's for the
day.  Your smartass neighbour is likely to mention something about ALSA being
so much better.  "The day ALSA can be considered stable is unlikely to be in
the same century that Bozo holds parties," is a good answer.  Learn it by
heart.  The curious of course can try whether there's a GLAME plugin compatible
to the ALSA version du jour.  If your lucky, @file{plughw:0,0} and 
@file{plughw:1,0} might be the correct settings for input and output.
Probably they aren't.

Now for some real fun.  From the Swapfile GUI, you can launch the Filternetwork
Editor.  @dfn{New Filternetwork} is the menu entry we're talking about.  You
are already familiar with the window that pops up--remember the wave factory?
This time, however, the factory is completely empty.  Two filters,
@file{audio_in} and @file{audio_out}, will make it work just-in-time, though.
For kicks, add a @file{flanger} filter as well, and connect it to both
@file{audio_in} and @file{audio_out}. 

@ifhtml
@image{pix/mickey1}
@end ifhtml

This setup is working but seriously lacking coolness.  Let's fiddle with some
parameters.  Right-click on the @file{flanger} icon and select
@dfn{Properties}.  Set the @dfn{effect depth} to 50ms, the @dfn{detune range}
to 25ms, @dfn{lfo speed} to 8Hz, @dfn{dry/wet balance} to 0.0 and the @dfn{LFO
Type} to Ramp Up.

@ifhtml
@image{pix/mickey2}
@end ifhtml

Once you click on @dfn{Execute} in the editor window, start talking into the
microphone.  Voila, you're talking like Mickey Mouse!  Now stop the network by
clicking on the Execute button again that has in the meantime morphed into
@dfn{Stop}.  Change the @dfn{LFO Type} to Ramp Down and execute the network
again.  Coolness factor rising, eh!?  Time to fire up your favourite mailer and
send a message to @email{mag@@glame.de}, telling him what cool a frood he is.
Some of the parameters you can even alter while the network is running.  Just
go on from here and play around.  Once you've found the Bozo killer setting,
the @dfn{Save} button is a good one to try next.

Now for a more sophisticated network: A sampler that will record your voice and
repeat it in an endless loop.  Bozo's dudes are gonna love it, honest.  First,
wire up the basic network from @file{audio_in}, @file{mix}, @file{one2n}, and
@file{audio_out}.  So far it's just a slightly complicated way of sending all
input to the output unmodified.  The network gets a lot more interesting when
we add a feedback loop.  Add a @file{buffer} filter, a @file{delay} filter, and
connect them sort of backwards.  That is, draw a second connection from
@file{one2n}'s output to the input of @file{buffer}.  Connect @file{buffer} to
@file{delay}, and finally hook up @file{delay}'s output to the input of
@file{mix}.

@ifhtml
@image{pix/loop1}
@end ifhtml

Still a little tuning to do.  There's a little blob on the connecting line
between @file{delay} and @file{mix}.  Right-click on it, and select
@dfn{Destination Properties} in the menu that pops up.  Set the @dfn{gain} to
1.9.  Next, open the properties dialog for the @file{buffer} filter and set the
@dfn{time} parameter to 1 second. In the @file{delay} filter's properties, set
the @dfn{delay time} to 500ms.  Turn down your amp really low, execute the
network and talk something intelligent like "Boh" into your microphone.  If a
screeching sound hurts your ears, the @dfn{gain} parameter probably is to high.
Click on the little blob again and tune it until you're satisfied.  If you set
it to smaller values, your voice will slowly fade out, if it's to high it will
just get louder and louder until your speakers freak out.  Obviously, an
endlessly repeating "Boh" isn't all that stunning.  "Zoh" sounds like a good
second line.  Talk into the microphone, and wow, here's our vocal
percussionist.  The party is your's, and hey, it's time to go now.  Send our
best to Bozo and the drags. Have fun!
