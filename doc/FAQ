Introduction
============

This file is intendet to evolve to a (frequently) asked questions with
answers document. To make this work people with questions should add
a line like
Q: I dont know nothing! Can you help me?
to the end of this file. Anyone who likes to answer to the question may
then add a line like
A[richi]: Well, no. RTFM!
after the question. TeXnold is supposed to do some moderating (i.e. spelling
fixes and reordering of Q & A) some times. Also topics that came up on
the development list or in the forum could be integrated as Q&A here (also
nolds task...)
