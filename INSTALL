				GLAME - Installation
				====================

There is nothing to install yet.

But if you want to build what is there just go the standard configure-way:
./configure
make

Or if you just checked out the CVS tree (which is highly recommended as 
development is going really fast at the moment) you first need to do
aclocal && autoheader && automake -a && autoconf
(try again until no error messages are left)

For more about GLAME have a look into the README file and the current
documentation in the doc/ directory. You also may want to read the source which
is entirely contained in the src/ directory.

	Yours, GLAME Team.
