				GLAME - Installation
				====================

If you just checked out the CVS tree (which is recommended if you
can cope with the usual report bug - wait for the fix - update cvs
cycle and want to be bleeding edge) you first need to initialize the
build system by doing
> ./autogen.sh

If this fails somehow you probably need to update your autoconf, automake,
libtool and/or gettext packages to more recent versions. See the requirements
section in the README file for more information.

If you got the source package or have already initialized the build
system you can install glame by doing (usually you want to specify
a prefix for the install directory, you can do this via ./configure
--prefix=/my/install/location, default is /usr/local)
> ./configure
> make
> make install

If you are using a debian system you may even use
> dpkg-buildpackage
to get a .deb package build which you may then install using dpkg.


Note that there are quite a lot of configure options (./configure --help)
of which the following may come handy if the build process is failing:
- --disable-gui disables the use of gnome - and thus the generation of
  the graphical user interface binary

If you experience bugs with glame, we encourage you to report them via
the bugtracking system of sourceforge or the development mailinglist.
Please try to be verbose about the failure, enabling extra debugging
output via the --enable-debug option is encouraged.


If you do not want to install the package, you can execute the generated
executables as (you _have_ to be in the src/ directory)
> cd src
> ./gui/glame
> ./cglame


For more about GLAME have a look into the README file and the current
documentation in the doc/ directory. You also may want to read the source which
is entirely contained in the src/ directory.

	Yours, GLAME Team.
