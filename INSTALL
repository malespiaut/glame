				GLAME - Installation
				====================

If you got the source package you can install glame by doing
> ./configure
> make
> make install

If you do not want to install the package, you can find the generated
executables in 
src/gui/glame
src/cglame

Or if you just checked out the CVS tree (which is highly recommended as 
development is going really fast at the moment) you first need to do
> ./autogen.sh
then proceed as stated above.

For more about GLAME have a look into the README file and the current
documentation in the doc/ directory. You also may want to read the source which
is entirely contained in the src/ directory.

	Yours, GLAME Team.
