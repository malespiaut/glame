				GLAME - Installation
				====================

Or if you just checked out the CVS tree (which is recommended if you
can cope with the usual report bug - wait for the fix - update cvs
cycle and want to be bleeding edge) you first need to initialize the
build system by doing
> ./autogen.sh

If you got the source package or have already initialized the build
system you can install glame by doing (usually you want to specify
a prefix for the install directory, you can do this via ./configure
--prefix=/my/install/location, default is /usr/local)
> ./configure
> make
> make install

If you are using a debian system you may even use
> dpkg-buildpackage
to get a .deb package build which you may then install using dpkg.


Note that there are quite a lot of configure options (./configure --help)
of which the following may come handy if the build process is failing:
- --disable-mp3lame disables the use of the mp3lame library for reading
  mp3 files - this may be necessary if you only have a static version of
  this libaray installed (symptoms for this are no file I/O plugins
  available, i.e. not working Import/Export)

If you experience bugs with glame, we encourage you to report them via
the bugtracking system of sourceforge or the development mailinglist.
Please try to be verbose about the failure, enabling extra debugging
output via the --enable-debug option is encouraged.

If you want to try out (or absolutely need) real-time applications such
as real-time sound synthesis or real-time effect generation you will need
to enable the low latency mode of GLAME via the --enable-low-latency switch
of configure. Note that this may slow down bulk operations but reduces
latency to below 5ms on an unloaded system (be sure to use decent sound
hardware - SB16/AWE ISA cards are known to fail).


If you do not want to install the package, you can execute the generated
executables as (you _have_ to be in the src/ directory)
> cd src
> ./gui/glame
> ./cglame


For more about GLAME have a look into the README file and the current
documentation in the doc/ directory. You also may want to read the source which
is entirely contained in the src/ directory.

	Yours, GLAME Team.
