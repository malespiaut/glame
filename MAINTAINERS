This file is to declare maintainers for the different subsystems.
Maintainers take final decisions about design and applying patches.
It is strongly discouraged to hack and cvs commit in a maintained
area without contacting the maintainer first.

Please add the filenames which are considered to belong to the
subsystem, too.
