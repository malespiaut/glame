This file is to declare maintainers for the different subsystems.
Maintainers take final decisions about design and applying patches.
It is strongly discouraged to hack and cvs commit in a maintainers
area without first communicating with him.

Please add the filenames which are considered to belong to the
subsystem, too.

swapfile: richi
	src/swapfile/*

filter: richi
	src/filter/filter*
	src/filter/* unless covered by other maintainers

hash: richi
	src/hash/*

doc: nold
	doc/*.texi
	doc/* unless covered by other maintainers

samplemath: nold
	src/samplemath/*

please add your stuff [richi]
