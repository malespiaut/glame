    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>This manual page documents briefly the &dhcmd; command that comes 
	as part of the &dhpackage; package.  Only a short summary of options
	is provided here.  More complete documentation to &dhcmd; comes
	in the &gnu; <application>Info</application> format; see below.</para>

    <para>&dhcmd; is a program that provides you with
	an easy-to-use and intuitive graphical frontend to edit and manipulate
	audio streams.  At least, it's meant to be easy-to-use and intuitive...
	&dhcmd; comprises of three parts: a main window, a wave editor, and
	a filternetwork editor.</para>

    <para>The main window offers a view of the so-called swapfile,
	&dhpackage;'s backing store that contains a hierarchical view of
	all tracks and projects currently edited.  The wave editor offers a
	time line view of one or more audio tracks and can perform simple
	editing tasks like cut, copy, and paste.  For more sophisticated
	actions, it interfaces with the filternetwork editor that allows
	grouping of a wide range of audio plugins and filters.  Both the
	wave and the filternetwork editor can be started from the main
	window via a context-senitive menu usually attached to the right
	mouse button and an entry in the menu bar on top,
	respectively.</para>

    <para>For more thorough descriptions on &dhcmd; and its possible uses
	please see the <application>Info</application> manual.</para>
