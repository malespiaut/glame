Description: A versatile audio processor.
 GLAME provides a powerful and extensible framework for processing
 audio files similar to what GIMP offers in the graphics area.  GLAME so
 far features a graphical frontend to set up filter networks and perform
 basic audio editing tasks.  A flexible Scheme-based command line editor
 offers low-level access for scripting purposes.
