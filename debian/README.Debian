GLAME for Debian
----------------

In addition to Glame's native plugins, you can also use plugins that follow
the Ladspa standard. The Debian version of Glame looks for Ladspa plugins
in /usr/lib/ladspa and /usr/local/lib/ladspa by default. Setting the
environment variable LADSPA_PATH, you can add further directories to the
search path. Multiple directories have to be separated by colons.
