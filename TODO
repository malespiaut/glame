TODOs of the various subsystems, [] tells about the person who is
supposed to fix it.

Stuff that was postponed for 0.4.x:
-----------------------------------

doc/
	- better documentation for scheme API
  	- filter writing tutorial?

plugins/
	[all]
	- file_io needs fixed libaudiofile support
	- provide pixmaps for all plugins (missing: echo, fft friends,
          iir, noisegate, pan, rms, time, ...)

hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling

filter/
	[richi]
	- implementation stuff
          * move (copy?) methods down to the actual users (filter_param_t
  	    and filter_pipe_t, filter_port_t) to allow separated filter_port_t
            existance
	  * fix the notion of network/node to child/parent relationships

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- simplify as much as possible / increase performance

hash/
	[richi]
	- add notion of "private" (?) signal handlers to glsignal which
          would be not copied - could remove some uglyness...

glmid/
	[richi]
	- script gpsm
	- add simple undo/redo stack to gpsm

gui/
	[all]
	- the timeline stuff is still missing
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet
	- kool splashscreen?

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- completely rewrite the ugly event handling in filter_network
	- add realtime controls
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & friends)
	- grouping!
	- fold/unfold of groups
	- connect for parameters of nodes of same type
	- implement model-view-controller paradigma, aka drive gui through backend signals
	- have GlameCanvas emit a signal after network execution so we
	  can update the swapfiles managed through the gpsm
