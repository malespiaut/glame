TODOs of the various subsystems/programs, [] tells about the
"maintainer" or the one who is supposed to fix it.

Things we (absolutely) need to do before 0.4.0:
-----------------------------------------------

doc/
	- document available filters [nold/the filter authors]
	  All the 0.2.0 relevant stuff is documented. The following
	  filters are entirely missing:
		fft_plugins.c:int fft_register(plugin_t *p)
		fft_plugins.c:int ifft_register(plugin_t *p)
		fft_plugins.c:int fft_resample_register(plugin_t *p)
		fft_plugins.c:int fft_equalizer_register(plugin_t *p)
		fft_plugins.c:int fft_bandpass_register(plugin_t *p)
		flanger.c:int flanger_register(plugin_t *p)
		time.c:int time_register(plugin_t *p)
	- update GUI documentation [all]

plugins/
	[all]
	- provide pixmaps for all plugins (missing: echo, fft friends,
          iir, noisegate, pan, rms, time, ...)

gui/
	[xwolf]
	- kool splashscreen?
	- property editing for network (external ports/properties/section...) ?
	- remove broken export tracking code


Items that can be postponed forever (at least until 0.6):
---------------------------------------------------------

doc/
	- document gpsm [richi]
	- better documentation for scheme API
  	- filter writing tutorial?

plugins/
	[all]
	- file_io needs fixed libaudiofile support

hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling

filter/
	[richi]
	- implementation stuff
          * move (copy?) methods down to the actual users (filter_param_t
  	    and filter_pipe_t, filter_port_t) to allow separated filter_port_t
            existance
	  * fix the notion of network/node to child/parent relationships

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- implement the transactions, restore undo/redo

glmid/
	[richi]
	- script gpsm

gui/
	[all]
	- the timeline stuff is still missing
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- completely rewrite the ugly event handling in filter_network
	- add realtime controls
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & friends)
	- grouping!
	- fold/unfold of groups
	- connect for parameters of nodes of same type
	- have GlameCanvas emit a signal after network execution so we
	  can update the swapfiles managed through the gpsm
