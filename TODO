TODOs of the various subsystems, [] tells about the person who is
supposed to fix it.


Stuff queued for backporting:
-----------------------------


Items pending:
==============

gtk/gnome-2.0 transition:
-------------------------
	- copy glame_ruler, glame_hruler and glame_curve from their
	  gtk+-2.0 source and re-modify them
	- make gtknob a subclass of GtkRange

other stuff:
------------

include/
	- Consider moving includes beyond a glame/ directory

doc/
	- add cglame section to the quick start guide
	- intl for dialogs/plugins
  	- filter writing tutorial

data/pixmaps/
	- provide pixmaps for plugins lacking one
	- provide toolbar icons replacing sucking ones

plugins/
	[all]
	- fix one2n/mix - try a feed-forward echo with large delay
          -> deadlock (because no feedback -> no fifo adjustion)
	- fix filters for RT param update
	- make offset/size params of swapfile_in RT
	- redo swapfile_in/out:
	  * allow RT adjustment of offset/size for swapfile_in
	  * allow specifying of pre-/post(?)- zero region
	- remove position pipe param from read_file
	- redo render with right semantics
	- write set param method for ladspa plugins
	- fix ladspa plugin wrapper to adhere filter API (connect methods,
	  pipe fixup handlers)
	- better ladspa gui

hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling
	  * implement fast conversion routine from float to int,
	    see http://mega-nerd.com/FPcast/

filter/
	[richi]

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- fix unhandled (MAP_PRIVATE, cluster_split) cases that PANIC
	  (i.e. introduce anonymous clusters)
	- resolve issues with ENOSPC and swapfile
	- swtest-filecow fails on MacOS X

glmid/
	[richi]
	- make clipboard.[ch] gpsm_edit.[ch] which handles delete/cut/
	  copy/paste/overwrite operations on groups returning the
	  result as new groups, i.e. not maintaining the clipboard
	  itself, just editing operations.
	- fix SMOB garbage collecting - introduce explicit object
	  dependencies (start with gpsm: guilify the tree).
	- fix gpsm placing/inserting checks for overlaps, fix
	  copy/link in swapfilegui then to use insert not place
	- do regression tests using cglame for gpsm stuff

glmid/glame_audiofile
	[nold]

gui/
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet
	- kool splashscreen?
	- try saving window positions between sessions
	[mag]
        - kewl analyze (lots of info) GUI
	- kewl resample GUI
	[richi]
	- fix audio_io preferences to not show audio_in/out and to
	  have params (including device and samplerate) be set by
	  a std param setting dialog

gui/tree
	[richi, xwolf]

gui/waveeditgui
	[richi]
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- toolbar needs work - ICONS!
	- do glame_ruler with time, samples, beats mode
	- show actual sample value/rms for marker
	- add pan/mix sliders
	- poll for selection change at play time, updating
	  swin params

gui/libgtkwaveform
	[richi, xwolf]
	- change color of background / foreground (make that configurable)
	- fix marker redrawing

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- do (simple) autorouter
	- remove port export marking, if removing exported port from
	  net properties dialog (fix that! - integrate in canvas directly?)
	- add drag&drop from swapfilegui (create swapfile_in/out nodes)
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & guile-gtk?
          & friends) - better try to adopt lcp
	- allow scheme expressions for network parameters to be specified
	  (replace redirecting parameters with default scheme wrapper)
