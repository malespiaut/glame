TODOs of the various subsystems, [] tells about the person who is
supposed to fix it.


Items pending for 0.5.x:
------------------------

include/
	- prefix LIST_ stuff with GLAME_ (BSD namespace)

doc/
	- better documentation for scheme API
  	- filter writing tutorial?

plugins/
	[all]
	- file_io needs fixed libaudiofile support
	- provide pixmaps for all plugins (missing: fft friends,
          iir, rms, ...)
	- fix one2n/mix - try a feed-forward echo with large delay
          -> deadlock (because no feedback -> no fifo adjustion)
	- add position hint parameters to null and drop

hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling

filter/
	[richi]
	- implementation stuff
          * move (copy?) methods down to the actual users (filter_param_t
  	    and filter_pipe_t, filter_port_t) to allow separated filter_port_t
            existance
	  * fix the notion of network/node to child/parent relationships

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- fix unhandled (MAP_PRIVATE, cluster_split) cases that PANIC
	  (i.e. introduce anonymous clusters)

hash/
	[richi]
	- add notion of "private" (?) signal handlers to glsignal which
          would be not copied - could remove some uglyness...

glmid/
	[richi]

gui/
	[all]
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet
	- kool splashscreen?

gui/swapfilegui
	[richi]
	- make it a full fledged window like the other widgets
          -> reduce pollution of main.c
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- progress bar for import & export
	- better UI

gui/waveeditgui
	[richi]
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- toolbar needs work

gui/libgtkwaveform
	[richi]
	- break up gtkwaveview into simple waveview without
          scrollbar, make a container that can contain multiple
          gtkwavebuffers
	- implement stack for selection and marker
	- support different wave display types (solid, dotted, outline...)
	- support hooks for changing pointer and getting interactive
          editing gtk signals / updating the wave

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- add realtime controls
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & friends)
	- grouping!
	- fold/unfold of groups
	- connect for parameters of nodes of same type
	- have GlameCanvas emit a signal after network execution so we
	  can update the swapfiles managed through the gpsm
