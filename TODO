TODOs of the various subsystems, [] tells about the person who is
supposed to fix it.


Known BUGS that should be fixed before 0.5.3:
---------------------------------------------
- the waveform widget broke by adding the signal handler
- new import dialog needs to be finished and replace the
  existing one

Known BUGS that should be fixed before 0.6.0:
---------------------------------------------
- with apply, rt adjustments of params is not supported
- toolbar icons of the waveedit window are not really intuitive...
- main/[Edit wave...] wavewidget needs a [Save] toolbar item
  that exports the wave back (and [Close] should delete the wave
  from the swapfile)
- new export dialog needs to be done and replace the existing one
- intl for other than main widget needs to be done
- looping support for swapfile_in filter and GUI


Other items pending:
--------------------

include/
	- Consider moving includes beyond a glame/ directory

doc/
	- better documentation for cglame, tutorial like
  	- filter writing tutorial

data/pixmaps/
	- provide pixmaps for plugins lacking one
	- provide toolbar icons replacing sucking ones

plugins/
	[all]
	- fix one2n/mix - try a feed-forward echo with large delay
          -> deadlock (because no feedback -> no fifo adjustion)
	- fix filters for RT param update

hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling

filter/
	[richi]
	- allow node reparenting without breaking connections

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- fix unhandled (MAP_PRIVATE, cluster_split) cases that PANIC
	  (i.e. introduce anonymous clusters)
	- resolve issues with ENOSPC and swapfile

glmid/
	[richi]
	- make clipboard.[ch] gpsm_edit.[ch] which handles delete/cut/
	  copy/paste/overwrite operations on groups returning the
	  result as new groups, i.e. not maintaining the clipboard
	  itself, just editing operations.
	- fix SMOB garbage collecting - introduce explicit object
	  dependencies (start with gpsm: guilify the tree).

gui/
	[all]
	- fix issues with non-modal dialogs in edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet
	- kool splashscreen?
	[mag]
	- kewl import/export GUI
        - kewl analyze (normalize & DC-offset & lots of info) GUI
	- kewl resample GUI
	[richi]
	- fix audio_io preferences to not show audio_in/out and to
	  have params (including device and samplerate) be set by
	  a std param setting dialog

gui/swapfilegui
	[richi]
	- make it a full fledged window like the other widgets
          -> reduce pollution of main.c
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- progress bar for import & export
	- better UI
	  * Edit wave... should delete swapfile at waveedit close
            time, a Save toolbar entry is needed, too (which exports
            the wave back)
          * Record wave... should do things like Edit wave, but start
            with an empty wave, ready for recording (after recording
            being in Edit wave mode)
	[XWolf]
	- add drag&drop to filtereditgui

gui/waveeditgui
	[richi]
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- toolbar needs work - ICONS!
	- do glame_ruler with time, samples, beats mode
	- show actual sample value/rms/position for marker

gui/libgtkwaveform
	[richi]
	- change color of background / foreground (make that configurable)

gui/libgtkwaveform2
	[richi]
	- break up gtkwaveview into simple waveview without
          scrollbar, make a container that can contain multiple
          gtkwavebuffers
	- implement stack for selection and marker
	- support different wave display types (solid, dotted, outline...)
	- support hooks for changing pointer and getting interactive
          editing gtk signals / updating the wave

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- add drag&drop from swapfilegui (create swapfile_in/out nodes)
	- duplication of groups
	- add realtime controls
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & guile-gtk?
          & friends)
	- fold/unfold of groups
	- connect for parameters of nodes of same type
	- have GlameCanvas check swapfile_out nodes for modified range
	  after network execution and invalidate the swapfiles appropriately
