TODOs of the various subsystems, [] tells about the person who is
supposed to fix it.

Items pending:
--------------

include/
	- Consider moving includes beyond a glame/ directory

doc/
	- add filteredit section to the quick start guide
	- add cglame section to the quick start guide
	- intl for other than main widget needs to be done
  	- filter writing tutorial

data/pixmaps/
	- provide pixmaps for plugins lacking one
	- provide toolbar icons replacing sucking ones

plugins/
	[all]
	- fix one2n/mix - try a feed-forward echo with large delay
          -> deadlock (because no feedback -> no fifo adjustion)
	- fix filters for RT param update
	- make offset/size params of swapfile_in RT
	- redo swapfile_in/out:
	  * allow RT adjustment of offset/size for swapfile_in
	  * allow specifying of pre-/post(?)- zero region
	- remove position pipe param from read_file
	- change pan filter to just change pipe position
	- redo render with right semantics
	- write set param method for ladspa plugins
	- better ladspa gui
hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling
	  * implement fast conversion routine from float to int,
	    see http://mega-nerd.com/FPcast/

filter/
	[richi]
	- make params & ports referenced counted objects that have
	  references in port/paramdbs, should clean up redirects
	  a lot, allows for shared params and the like

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- fix unhandled (MAP_PRIVATE, cluster_split) cases that PANIC
	  (i.e. introduce anonymous clusters)
	- resolve issues with ENOSPC and swapfile

glmid/
	[richi]
	- make clipboard.[ch] gpsm_edit.[ch] which handles delete/cut/
	  copy/paste/overwrite operations on groups returning the
	  result as new groups, i.e. not maintaining the clipboard
	  itself, just editing operations.
	- fix SMOB garbage collecting - introduce explicit object
	  dependencies (start with gpsm: guilify the tree).
	- fix gpsm placing/inserting checks for overlaps, fix
	  copy/link in swapfilegui then to use insert not place

glmid/glame_audiofile
	[nold]
	- support mp3/ogg reading/writing

gui/
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet
	- kool splashscreen?
	[mag]
        - kewl analyze (lots of info) GUI
	- kewl resample GUI
	[richi]
	- fix audio_io preferences to not show audio_in/out and to
	  have params (including device and samplerate) be set by
	  a std param setting dialog

gui/swapfilegui
	[richi]
	- exchange item labels for pan/mix sliders in vbox with
          two lines label on the right, group labels for mix sliders
          with group label on the right
	- make it a full fledged window like the other widgets
          -> reduce pollution of main.c
	  (rather merge with timeline)
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- better UI
          * Record wave... should do things like Edit wave, but start
            with an empty wave, ready for recording (after recording
            being in Edit wave mode)
	[XWolf]
	- add drag&drop to filtereditgui

gui/waveeditgui
	[richi]
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- toolbar needs work - ICONS!
	- do glame_ruler with time, samples, beats mode
	- show actual sample value/rms/position for marker
	- add pan/mix sliders
	- poll for selection change at play time, updating
	  swin params

gui/libgtkwaveform
	[xwolf]
	- change color of background / foreground (make that configurable)

gui/libgtkwaveform2
	[richi]
	- break up gtkwaveview into simple waveview without
          scrollbar, make a container that can contain multiple
          gtkwavebuffers
	- implement stack for selection and marker
	- support different wave display types (solid, dotted, outline...)
	- support hooks for changing pointer and getting interactive
          editing gtk signals / updating the wave

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- do (simple) autorouter
	- remove port export marking, if removing exported port from

	- add drag&drop from swapfilegui (create swapfile_in/out nodes)
	- add realtime controls
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & guile-gtk?
          & friends)
	- do grouping using expand/collapse functionality of the backend?
