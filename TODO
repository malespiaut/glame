include/
	- prefix LIST_ stuff with GLAME_ (BSD namespace)

doc/
	- better documentation for scheme API
  	- filter writing tutorial?

plugins/
	[all]
	- provide pixmaps for all plugins (missing: fft friends,
          iir, rms, ...)
	- fix one2n/mix - try a feed-forward echo with large delay
          -> deadlock (because no feedback -> no fifo adjustion)
	- fix filters for RT param update
	[richi]
	- do gpsm invalidating using swapfile_out filter output params

hash/
	[all]
        - glsimd
          * think of useful SIMD operations with good (ask richi) API 
          * do 3dnow, isse, mmx, etc. versions of existing operations
          * think of how to do run-time detection/profiling

filter/
	[richi]
	- allow node reparenting without breaking connections
	- implementation stuff
          * move (copy?) methods down to the actual users (filter_param_t
  	    and filter_pipe_t, filter_port_t) to allow separated filter_port_t
            existance
	  * fix the notion of network/node to child/parent relationships

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- fix unhandled (MAP_PRIVATE, cluster_split) cases that PANIC
	  (i.e. introduce anonymous clusters)
	- resolve issues with ENOSPC and swapfile

hash/

glmid/
	[richi]
	- make clipboard.[ch] gpsm_edit.[ch] which handles delete/cut/
	  copy/paste/overwrite operations on groups returning the
	  result as new groups, i.e. not maintaining the clipboard
	  itself, just editing operations.

gui/
	[all]
	- fix issues with non-modal dialogs in edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- D&D in swapfile/wave/filternet
	- kool splashscreen?
	[mag]
	- kewl import/export GUI
        - kewl analyze (normalize & DC-offset & lots of info) GUI
	- kewl resample GUI

gui/swapfilegui
	[richi]
	- make it a full fledged window like the other widgets
          -> reduce pollution of main.c
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- progress bar for import & export
	- better UI
	  * Edit wave... should delete swapfile at waveedit close
            time, a Save toolbar entry is needed, too (which exports
            the wave back)
          * Record wave... should do things like Edit wave, but start
            with an empty wave, ready for recording (after recording
            being in Edit wave mode)
	[XWolf]
	- add drag&drop to filtereditgui

gui/waveeditgui
	[richi]
	- seperate into subdirectory
	- toolbar needs work - ICONS!
	- do glame_ruler with time, samples, beats mode
	- show actual sample value/rms/position for marker

gui/libgtkwaveform
	[richi]
	- !!! fix redrawing errors !!!
	- break up gtkwaveview into simple waveview without
          scrollbar, make a container that can contain multiple
          gtkwavebuffers
	- implement stack for selection and marker
	- support different wave display types (solid, dotted, outline...)
	- support hooks for changing pointer and getting interactive
          editing gtk signals / updating the wave

gui/edit_filter
	[xwolf]
	- add drag&drop from swapfilegui (create swapfile_in/out nodes)
	- duplication of groups
	- add realtime controls
	- add support for custom property dialogs (glade & guile-gtk?
          & friends)
	- fold/unfold of groups
	- connect for parameters of nodes of same type
	- have GlameCanvas check swapfile_out nodes for modified range
	  after network execution and invalidate the swapfiles appropriately
