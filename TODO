TODOs of the various subsystems/programs, [] tells about the
"maintainer" or the one who is supposed to fix it.

doc/
	- document available filters [nold/the filter authors]
	  All the 0.2.0 relevant stuff is documented.
  	- fix API documentation (changed filter part again) [done, parts
    	  are still missing]
  	- filter writing tutorial?

plugins/
	- we need pixmaps

glmid/gltrack.[ch], plugins/track_io.c
	- rethink wrt wave gui

filter/
	[richi]
        - parameters:
          * allow shared parameters
        - general class stuff
	  * get rid of these *_desc_t stuff - just clone example
            instances. Left to kill are portdesc and filter itself.
        - API/implementation stuff
          * are hashes really necessary? (we need lists anyway)
          * symmetry: name vs. pointer APIs
	  * there are way too many API functions...

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- redo transactions and high level operations, i.e.
	  clean them up - first step done (it works)
	- redo the lowlevel part (fuse runtime and on-disk structures,
	  use meta part of the swapfile directly)

gui/
	[all]
	- we need some ideas how to do the wave-editing stuff, especially
          how to couple it with the filter stuff.
	- needs to support pipe parameters
  	- this middle/right button stuff needs to be changed to
    	  context menus
