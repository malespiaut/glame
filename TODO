TODOs of the various subsystems/programs, [] tells about the
"maintainer" or the one who is supposed to fix it.

doc/
	- document available filters [nold/the filter authors]

filter/
	- scripting - do a scheme interface [richi/mainzelM?]
	AFTER glame-1.0 [richi]
        - parameters:
          * abstraction from the parameter domain, i.e.
            in principle allow parameters of everyting
          * better type abstraction of the parameter, perhaps
            move to a textual type description (like XML...)
          * allow shared parameters, i.e. only loosely couple
            parameters with their domain
        - general class stuff
          * symmetry. filter_portdesc_t needs an instance - this
            should allow filter_pipe_t to be more decoupled also
            which should allow filternode filters to be simplified,
            too
          * methods: some of them are really notifier signals - 
            provide a generic signal/signalhandler framework - this
            should allow the GUI to register handlers, too
            real methods are: connect_in/out, set_param
        - API/implementation stuff
          * are hashes really necessary? (we need lists anyway)
          * symmetry: name vs. pointer APIs
	  * there are way too many API functions...
          * -> move from API functions to method calls where
            appropriate?

swapfile/
	- redo transactions and high level operations, i.e.
	  clean them up - first step done (it works) [richi]
	- redo the lowlevel part (fuse runtime and on-disk structures,
	  use meta part of the swapfile directly) [richi]

channel/
	- fix channel->type, split it into type and position field
          modelled after the SAMPLE pipe property hangle.

gui/
	- we need some ideas how to do the wave-editing stuff, especially
          how to couple it with the filter stuff.

glame/cglame
	nothing there [all]
