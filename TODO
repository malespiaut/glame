TODOs of the various subsystems/programs, [] tells about the
"maintainer" or the one who is supposed to fix it.

doc/
	- document available filters [nold/the filter authors]
	  All the 0.2.0 relevant stuff is documented.
  	- fix API documentation (changed filter part again) [done, parts
    	  are still missing]
  	- filter writing tutorial?

plugins/
	- we need pixmaps

filter/
	[richi]
        - parameters:
          * allow shared parameters
        - API stuff
          * are hashes really necessary? (we need lists anyway)
	  * Completely script (the new) filter API - use smobs?
	  * Update documentation
	- implementation stuff
          * move (copy?) methods down to the actual users (filter_param_t
  	    and filter_pipe_t, filter_port_t) to allow separated filter_port_t
            existance
	  * fix the notion of network/node to child/parent relationships

swapfile/
        [richi]
	- implement the transactions, restore undo/redo

gui/
	[all]
	- get rid of the icon canvas for the filter stuff and do it
          in categorized popup menu
	- allow load/save of networks
	- we need some ideas how to do the wave-editing stuff, especially
          how to couple it with the filter stuff.
