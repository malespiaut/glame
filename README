Quick Start for the impatient
=============================
If you got a glame tarball just do the usual
> ./configure && make && make install
and you will get the programs 'glame' and 'cglame' installed.

If you checked out the glame cvs first do
> ./autogen.sh
If you do not want to install glame, you can find 'glame' in
'src/gui/glame' and 'cglame' in 'src/cglame'.

There is a command line interface to glame (with some extended
features and with some features missing) called 'cglame'. You will end
in a scheme shell after launching cglame and have access to the
backends and the midlayer API. Look into src/glmid/glame.scm for some
example scheme code.

With the GUI 'glame' you are provided with a full featured wave-editor.
A filter network editor allows you to create custom effects and do realtime
processing.

You want to contribute? Please join our mailinglist (glame-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
and ask for a task. If you just want to write some filters a start is the excellent
filter API documentation in doc/ and of course many existing filters whose
source can be found in the src/plugins directory.


Requirements
============
- The only supported platform so far is GNU/Linux, but Glame may
  compile and run on any sufficiently POSIX compatible system.
  Supported (tested) architectures are Intel x86 compatible and PowerPC.
  On all platforms gcc is required to compile GLAME, using version
  3.3 or later is highly recommended.
- You need glibc-2.x on Linux.
- For the GUI part, you need recent versions of the Gtk+-2.6 and GNOME-2.6
  libraries with deprecated features built in.
- The scripting part makes use of guile; upgrading to the lastest and 
  greatest here is a good idea too, in case anything doesn't work as 
  expected (latest 1.4 and latest 1.6 releases are known to work).
- Another requirement is a recent libxml2 which is used by the midlayer.
- For developing you need autoconf version 2.59 or later and automake
  of the 1.9 series as well as recent libtool and gettext at least
  version 0.11.3.
- For full-featured I/O to files a recent version of libaudiofile is
  needed (at least 0.2.2 is required for libaudiofile support to be
  included).
- To enable Mp3 and Ogg import and export support you need to have libmad and
  libvorbisfile and libvorbisenc of at least version 1.0 installed.
- For full-featured I/O to your soundcard use ALSA version 1.0, though
  OSS may suffice, too.


Current Status (as of version 2.0.1):
=====================================
- usable GUI - src/gui/glame
  * wave editor
  * filter network editor for customizing filters
- usable console UI - src/cglame
  * scripting of GLAME via the Scheme language
- user and development documentation
- on-line help
- the glame midlayer which supports
  * plugins
  * scripting (using guile)
  * hierarchical organization and processing of wave data
- the filternetwork backend which supports
  * threading, i.e. pipelined processing of all data
  * feedback inside the network does work
  * zero-copy operation inside and between filters
  * realtime parameter updates
- the swapfile backing store


Thats all folks!

	Yours, GLAME-Team.
