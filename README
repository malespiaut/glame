This is GLAME 0.5.3 - GNU/Linux Audio Mechanics development release.

GLAME is meant to be the GIMP of audio processing. It is designed to be
a powerful, fast, stable, and easily extensible sound editor for Linux
and compatible systems. Supported platforms are Linux, BSD and IRIX.

Quick Start for the impatient
=============================
If you got a glame tarball just do the usual
> ./configure && make && make install
and you will get the programs 'glame' and 'cglame' installed.
If you checked out the glame cvs first do
> ./autogen.sh
If you do not want to install glame, you can find 'glame' in
'src/gui/glame' and 'cglame' in 'src/cglame'.

There is a command line interface to glame (with some extended
features and with some features missing) called 'cglame'. You will end
in a scheme shell after launching cglame and have access to the
backends and the midlayer API. Look into src/glmid/glame.scm for some
example scheme code.

With the GUI 'glame' you are provided with a full featured filter network
editor that allows you to create custom effects and to do realtime
processing. Also viewing and editing (cut & paste and applying effects)
of waves is supported. Basic sequencing of waves is supported via the
preliminary timeline.

Want more? Then join our devel team at SourceForge! An e-mail to
glame-devel@lists.sourceforge.net will get you going.

You want to contribute? Please join our mailinglist (see above) and ask
for a task. If you just want to write some filters a start is the excellent
filter API documentation in doc/ and of course many existing filters whose
source can be found in the src/plugins directory.


Requirements
============
- Supported platforms so far are Linux, IRIX6.5 and BSD, we occasionally try
  to make it compile on Solaris, AIX and HP-UX. Supported (tested)
  architectures are Intel x86 compatible, PowerPC and MIPS (IRIX only).
  On all platforms gcc is required to compile GLAME, using version
  2.95.2 or later is highly recommended.
- You may need glibc2.x on Linux, other versions were not tested.
- For the GUI part, it's best to try with recent versions of the
  Gtk+ and GNOME libs (those from the gnome distributions starting at
  version 1.0 should suffice). configure --disable-gui is your friend...
- The scripting part makes use of guile; upgrading to the lastest and 
  greatest here is a good idea too, in case anything doesn't work as 
  expected (version 1.3.4 and up are known to work).
- Another requirement is a recent libxml which is used by the midlayer.
- For developing you need recent versions of autoconf, automake and
  libtool.
- For full-featured I/O to files a recent version of libaudiofile is
  needed (at least 0.2.2 is required for libaudiofile support to be
  included)
- For full-featured I/O to your soundcard use ALSA version 0.9, though
  OSS may suffice, too


Current Status (as of version 0.5.3):
=====================================
- usable GUI - src/gui/glame
  * wave editor
  * filter network editor for customizing filters
  * timeline (preliminary) for sequencing
- usable console UI - src/cglame
  * scripting of GLAME via the Scheme language
- user and development documentation
- on-line help
- the glame midlayer which supports
  * plugins
  * scripting (using guile)
  * hierarchical organization and processing of wave data
- the filternetwork backend which supports
  * threading, i.e. pipelined processing of all data
  * feedback inside the network does work
  * zero-copy operation inside and between filters
  * realtime parameter updates
- the swapfile backing store


Thats all folks!

	Yours, GLAME-Team.
