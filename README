This is GLAME v0.1.29 - GNU/Linux Audio Mechanics ALPHA release.

This will be the first usable wav editor for linux.
It will be actually a lot more than a wav editor! [richi]

Quick Start for the impatient
=============================
Don't look for an executable named 'glame'. There is none, at least 
nothing useful. Which doesn't mean there's nothing to use. To test and
setup filter networks, go to src/filter and try the executable 
test_network on various of the net_test_* files supplied there. A brief
summary on how to setup your own net_test_ files is in the texinfo 
documentation in doc/. A preliminary GUI is there as well, just try
src/gui/main. You can query filter properties, create networks, set
parameters and listen to the output - that's all at the moment.

The only really useful UI is cglame, console glame for now. You will end
in a scheme shell after launching cglame and have access to the backends
and the midlayer API. Look into src/glmid/play.scm for some example scheme
stuff (try "(load "play.scm")" at the guile> command prompt). 

Want more? Then join our devel team at SourceForge! An e-mail to
glame-devel@lists.sourceforge.net will get you going.

You want to contribute? Please join our mailinglist (see above) and ask
for a task. If you just want to write some filters a start is the excellent
filter API documentation in doc/

Requirements
============
- Supported platforms so far are Linux and IRIX, we occasionally try to 
  make it compile on Solaris, AIX, and BSD.
- You may need glibc2.x on Linux, other versions were not tested.
- For the GUI part, it's best to try with the very latest versions of
  GTK+, GNOME libs. configure --disable-gui is your friend...
- The scripting part makes use of GUILE; upgrading to the lastest and 
  greatest here is a good idea too, in case anything doesn't work as 
  expected.
