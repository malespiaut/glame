Quick Start for the impatient [FIXME]
=============================
If you have all necessary libraries for building the gui frontend you
can find the 'glame' executable in src/gui/

The only really useful UI is cglame, console glame for now. You will end
in a scheme shell after launching cglame and have access to the backends
and the midlayer API. Look into src/glmid/play.scm for some example scheme
stuff (try "(load "play.scm")" at the guile> command prompt). 

Want more? Then join our devel team at SourceForge! An e-mail to
glame-devel@lists.sourceforge.net will get you going.

You want to contribute? Please join our mailinglist (see above) and ask
for a task. If you just want to write some filters a start is the excellent
filter API documentation in doc/

Requirements
============
- Supported platforms so far are Linux and IRIX, we occasionally try to 
  make it compile on Solaris, AIX, and BSD.
- You may need glibc2.x on Linux, other versions were not tested.
- For the GUI part, it's best to try with the very latest versions of
  GTK+, GNOME libs. configure --disable-gui is your friend...
- The scripting part makes use of GUILE; upgrading to the lastest and 
  greatest here is a good idea too, in case anything doesn't work as 
  expected.


Current Status (as of version 0.1.31):
======================================
- usable filternetwork GUI - src/gui/glame
- usable console UI - src/cglame
- the glame midlayer which supports
  * plugins
  * scripting (using guile)
- the filternetwork backend which supports
  * threading, i.e. pipelined processing of all data
  * feedback inside the network does work
  * zero-copy operation inside and between filters
- the swapfile backing store


Thats all folks!

	Yours, GLAME-Team.
