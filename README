Quick Start for the impatient
=============================
If you got a glame tarball just do the usual
> ./configure && make && make install
and you will get the programs 'glame', 'cglame' and 'gmkswap' installed.
If you checked out the glame cvs first do
> ./autogen.sh
If you do not want to install glame, you can find 'glame' in
'src/gui/glame', 'cglame' in 'src/cglame' and 'gmkswap' in 'src/swapfile'.

The only really useful UI is 'cglame', console glame for now. You will end
in a scheme shell after launching cglame and have access to the backends
and the midlayer API. Look into src/glmid/glame.scm for some example scheme
code.
With the GUI 'glame' you do not have access to all features of glame at
the moment. But experimenting with filternetworks is possible.

Want more? Then join our devel team at SourceForge! An e-mail to
glame-devel@lists.sourceforge.net will get you going.

You want to contribute? Please join our mailinglist (see above) and ask
for a task. If you just want to write some filters a start is the excellent
filter API documentation in doc/


Requirements
============
- Supported platforms so far are Linux and IRIX, we occasionally try to 
  make it compile on Solaris, AIX, and BSD.
- You may need glibc2.x on Linux, other versions were not tested.
- For the GUI part, it's best to try with the very latest versions of
  GTK+, GNOME libs. configure --disable-gui is your friend...
- The scripting part makes use of GUILE; upgrading to the lastest and 
  greatest here is a good idea too, in case anything doesn't work as 
  expected.
- For developing you need recent versions of autoconf, automake and
  libtool.


Current Status (as of version 0.2.0):
==========================================
- usable filternetwork GUI - src/gui/glame
- usable console UI - src/cglame
- the glame midlayer which supports
  * plugins
  * scripting (using guile)
- the filternetwork backend which supports
  * threading, i.e. pipelined processing of all data
  * feedback inside the network does work
  * zero-copy operation inside and between filters
- the swapfile backing store


Thats all folks!

	Yours, GLAME-Team.
