This is GLAME v0.025 - GNU/Linux Audio Mechanics ALPHA release.

This will be the first usable wav editor for linux.
It will be actually a lot more than a wav editor! [richi]

Quick Start for the impatient
=============================
Don't look for an executable named 'glame'. There is none, at least 
nothing useful. Which doesn't mean there's nothing to use. To test and
setup filter networks, go to src/filter and try the executable 
test_network on various of the net_test_* files supplied there. A brief
summary on how to setup your own net_test_ files is in the texinfo 
documentation in doc/. A preliminary GUI is there as well, just try
src/gui/main. You can query filter properties at the moment and have fun
testing a little drag'n'drop but that's about all at the moment.

Want more? Then join our devel team at SourceForge! An e-mail to
glame-devel@lists.sourceforge.net will get you going.

You want to contribute? Please join our mailinglist (see above) and ask
for a task. If you just want to write some filters a start is the excellent
filter API documentation in doc/
