The following people have unknowingly contributed to GLAME:

All low-level assembler locking and atomic ops code, and the list.h code
        were copied from the linux kernel source which was written by
        Linus Torvalds and many many others. hash.h also was largely
        inspired by the hashing code used in the mm of the linux kernel.

src/gui/libgtkwaveform and src/util/glame_*ruler* were "stolen" from the
	libgtkwaveform-0.[23].2 packages which are maintained by
	          David A. Bartold <foxx@mail.utexas.edu>
        and have contributions from Ben De Rydt <ben.de.rydt@pandora.be>.
