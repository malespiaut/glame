All low-level assembler locking and atomic ops code and the list.h code
        was copied from the linux kernel source which was written by
        Linus Torvalds and many many others. hash.h also was largely
        inspired by the hashing code used in the mm of the linux kernel.

src/gui/libgtkwaveform was "stolen" from the libgtkwaveformi-0.2.2
	package which is maintained by David A. Bartold <foxx@mail.utexas.edu>
        and has contributions from Ben De Rydt <ben.de.rydt@pandora.be>
