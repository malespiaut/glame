All low-level assembler locking and atomic ops code and the list.h code
        was copied from the linux kernel source which was written by
        Linus Torvalds and many many others. hash.h also was largely
        inspired by the hashing code used in the mm of the linux kernel.

src/gui/libgtkwaveform was "stolen" from the libgtkwaveform-0.2.2
	package which is maintained by David A. Bartold <foxx@mail.utexas.edu>
        and has contributions from Ben De Rydt <ben.de.rydt@pandora.be>.

LADSPA support was added initially by Richard Furse

The time filter was contributed by Stuart Purdie and was later renamed
	to pulse and cleaned up by nold.

Lots of cool plugin icons were contributed by Jesse Duke <darkphotn@yahoo.com>

Menu and toobar icons were contributed by Kristian Korseby <kristian@korseby.net>

Random stuff (mostly .cvsignores) was contributed by Jim Garrison.

The glame.de domain is sponsored by Dirk Staneker <jsux@glame.de>.
