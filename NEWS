GLAME version 0.3.4:
====================
Again a development phase. Many things changed between
0.2.0 and 0.3.4:
- filter backend rewrite which results in
  * out of sync documentation
  * cleaner parameter handling
  * notifiers for GUI and the like
- plugins more flexible, LADSPA plugin support
- GUI has support for pipe parameters, more nice
  context menus

GLAME version 0.2.0:
====================
Not much has changed since the last prerelease apart
from bugfixes and documentation updates.


Current Status (as of version 0.2.0-pre2):
==========================================
- usable filternetwork GUI - src/gui/glame
- usable console UI - src/cglame
- the glame midlayer which supports
  * plugins
  * scripting (using guile)
- the filternetwork backend which supports
  * threading, i.e. pipelined processing of all data
  * feedback inside the network does work
  * zero-copy operation inside and between filters
- the swapfile backing store
