GLAME development version 0.5.2:
================================
Bugfixed sneak preview release after LinuxTag. Changes since 0.5.1:
- re-enabled (and reimplemented) grouping in the filternetwork editor
- more do-what-user-would-expect in swapfile and waveedit GUI
- undo for deletion of tracks within the swapfile GUI
- realtime parameter updates for some plugins
- less modal dialogs
- better user interaction on errors
- bugfixes

GLAME development version 0.5.1:
================================
Feature sneak preview release for LinuxTag. Changes since 0.4.x:
- we have a timeline view where you can interactively sequence
  waves
- stuff like filter applying, playing and recording give you feedback
  now - either with a progress bar or similar or via a scrolling marker
- everywhere toolbars were added which expose the most frequently
  used operations
- support was added for non-filter-like operations like normalize and
  fade
- latency can now be configured in the preferences menu rather than
  at compile time
- we got a scheme console within the GUI and the scheme subsystem now
  uses more features from guile (like modules)
- the swapfile backend was simplified (and received nice speedup)
- we got a flexible keybinding framework (and some default keybindings)
- more stuff I dont remember...

GLAME version 0.4.2:
====================
Bugfix stable release of GLAME. Changes since 0.4.0:
- two major bugs were fixed in the swapfile backend which could
  lead to corrupted swapfiles (and GLAME panicing)

GLAME version 0.4.0:
====================
The second stable release of GLAME - finally. Changes since 0.4.0beta:

  (such as adding "native" support for playback and recording)
- updated documentation and on-line help

GLAME version 0.4.0beta:
========================
Feature freeze and bug squashing phase. The GUI has been
largely rewritten and extended. Changes since 0.2.0:

- wave viewing and editing widget

GLAME version 0.3.4:

Again a development phase. Many things changed between
0.2.0 and 0.3.4:
- filter backend rewrite which results in
  * out of sync documentation
  * cleaner parameter handling
  * notifiers for GUI and the like
- plugins more flexible, LADSPA plugin support
- GUI has support for pipe parameters, more nice
  context menus

GLAME version 0.2.0:
====================
Not much has changed since the last prerelease apart
from bugfixes and documentation updates.

GLAME version 0.2.0-pre2:
=========================
- usable filternetwork GUI - src/gui/glame
- usable console UI - src/cglame
- the glame midlayer which supports
  * plugins
  * scripting (using guile)
- the filternetwork backend which supports
  * threading, i.e. pipelined processing of all data
  * feedback inside the network does work
  * zero-copy operation inside and between filters
- the swapfile backing store
